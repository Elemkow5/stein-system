# /daily — Morning Brief

Pulls today's calendar, surfaces what's open, processes anything new, and produces a single clear plan for the day. Run this first thing every morning.

---

## Step 1 — Read the Board

Read `Brain/Master.md`. Note:
- What's in Today (carry-forward from yesterday or set during last /wrap)
- What's in This Week for today's date
- Any overdue items from previous days

Read `Brain/Inbox.md`. Count unprocessed items — flag if there are more than 5.

---

## Step 2 — Pull the Calendar

Pull today's events from the connected calendar (Google or Microsoft — whichever is configured in `System/integrations.yaml`).

For each event today, surface:
- Time and title
- Who's attending (names)
- Check `Brain/People/` for a file matching each attendee — if found, pull: last discussion topic, any open items, what they care about
- Also check that file's `## Open Commitments` section — surface anything owed to this person that's due today or overdue
- If no People file exists for an attendee: note their name and suggest creating one after the meeting

Format:

```
📅 [Time] — [Meeting Title]
   With: [Names]
   Context: [1-2 lines from People file, or "No file yet — consider creating one after this meeting"]
   Open items: [Any open action items from prior interactions]
   ⏰ You owe them: [Any Open Commitments due today/overdue, or omit this line if none]
```

If no calendar is connected, skip this step and note: "Calendar not connected — run the setup guide in System/Setup/ to connect."

---

## Step 2b — Read Recent Emails + Update People Files

Check `System/integrations.yaml` for email platform (Google or Microsoft). If email is not connected, skip this step silently.

Pull emails from the last 48 hours. For each email:

1. Check if the sender has a file in `Brain/People/`. Match by name or email address.
2. **If a People file exists:** append a dated interaction entry to the bottom of their file:
   ```
   ## [YYYY-MM-DD] Email
   **Subject:** [subject line]
   **Summary:** [1-2 sentences — what they said, what they asked, what they mentioned]
   **Action needed:** [yes/no — and what, if yes]
   ```
   Do this silently — no announcement to the client.

3. **If no People file exists AND the sender appears more than once in recent history OR is attending a meeting today:** create `Brain/People/[Name].md` using the template:
   ```markdown
   # [Full Name]

   **Role:**
   **Company:**
   **Relationship type:**
   **How decisions get made:**

   ---

   ## Last Interaction
   *Date:* [today]
   *What was discussed:* [from email]
   *What's open:* [any action items or questions]

   ---

   ## Notes

   ---

   ## Open Items
   - [ ]
   ```
   Fill in what can be inferred from the email. Leave blanks where unknown. No announcement.

4. **For today's meeting attendees specifically:** after updating all People files, flag any attendee who had email activity in the last 48 hours. Surface this in Step 2's meeting block:
   ```
   📧 Recent email: [subject] — [one-line summary]
   ```
   This appears directly under the meeting context so the client sees it before walking in.

---

## Step 3 — Read the Priorities

Read `Personality/Priorities.yaml`. Surface the top 1-2 active priorities — the things that should be getting the most time and attention right now.

Check: does Today's task list reflect those priorities? If the calendar is full of noise and the priorities have no tasks, flag it.

---

## Step 3b — Competitor Signals (if active)

Check if `Brain/Intelligence/Competitors/` exists. If not, skip this step silently.

If it exists, check `Brain/Intelligence/Weekly/` for any file modified in the last 24 hours:

```bash
find "Brain/Intelligence/Weekly" -name "*.md" -newer "Brain/Intelligence/Weekly/_placeholder.md" \
  -not -name "_placeholder.md" 2>/dev/null | sort -r | head -1
```

If a recent weekly digest file is found, read it and extract:
- The Summary section (2-3 sentences)
- Any Action Items

Surface in the daily plan as:

```
🔍 COMPETITOR SIGNALS — [digest date]
[Summary from digest]
Action: [action item if any, or omit]
Full report: Brain/Intelligence/Weekly/[date].md
```

If no weekly digest was updated in the last 24 hours: skip this section entirely — no header, no placeholder.

---

## Step 4 — Build Today's Task List

Consolidate:
- Items already in Today in Master.md
- This Week items for today's date
- Any urgent inbox items

Rules:
- No more than 5-6 tasks. Be honest about what's actually doable.
- Active P0 priorities get a slot.
- Overdue items from prior days go in Today automatically.

---

## Step 5 — Save the Daily Plan

Save to `Brain/Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

```markdown
# Daily Plan — [DATE]

## The One Thing
[Filled in Step 6]

## Calendar
[Today's meetings with context — from Step 2]

## Today's Tasks
- [ ] Task
- [ ] Task
...

## Carry-Forward
[Anything overdue or rolling from yesterday]
```

---

## Step 6 — The One Thing

Ask:
> "What's the single most important thing today — the one that, if done, makes the day a win regardless of everything else?"

Write it at the top of the daily file under **The One Thing**.

If they're unsure, prompt with: "Look at your Priorities. What would move the needle most on your P0 priority?"

---

## Step 7 — Update Master.md

- Confirm Today section reflects the final task list
- Move any new THIS WEEK items to the correct day
- Move new backlog items to the Backlog section
- Clear processed inbox items from Brain/Inbox.md

---

## Step 8 — Pattern Check

Scan the task list and calendar. One observation only if something stands out — a priority that's missing, a meeting-heavy day with no deep work, an overdue item that keeps rolling. One line. No lecture.

---

## Step 9 — Close

End with the daily plan summary and: "You're set. Go do the thing."

---

## Notes

- If run in the afternoon: skip morning framing, plan the rest of the day.
- If calendar shows no events: confirm the MCP is connected before concluding the day is clear.
- The daily file is a snapshot — it doesn't change after this point. Live tracking happens in Master.md.
- People files are in `Brain/People/[Name].md` — check by first name or full name.
