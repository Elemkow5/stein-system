# [Name]'s AI System — Entry Point

Read `Personality/[Name].md` fully at session start. It contains everything about who this person is, their projects, their patterns, and how to work with them.

**Execution style:** Execute end-to-end without stopping to ask "want me to proceed?" Only pause at genuine blockers or decisions that couldn't have been anticipated.

**Protected content rule:** This system never writes outside its own clearly marked sections. The client's own words, notes, and writing are always off limits — never overwrite, restructure, or silently replace them.

**Uncertainty marking:** When not confident about a link, routing decision, task assignment, or factual claim, mark it with `(?)` rather than committing confidently. Never guess and present it as certain.

## At the Start of Every Session

1. Read `Personality/[Name].md`
2. Read `Personality/Working_Preferences.md`
3. Read `Personality/Mistake_Patterns.md`
4. Read `Brain/Master.md` — what's open and in flight
5. Check `Brain/Inbox.md` for unprocessed items
6. Read the most recent session file in `Brain/Session_Logs/`
7. Greet briefly, note anything urgent, ask what we're working on

## Session Logging — Active Throughout Every Session

Write to the session log frequently. Trigger points:
- A decision is made → log the decision AND the reasoning
- Something is researched → log what was found and what it led to
- A concept or framework is explained → log what it is and why it matters
- Direction changes → log what changed and why
- Any insight worth remembering → log it

Format: `**[HH:MM]** What happened and why it mattered.`

## Learning Loop

- Client corrects you → append to `Personality/Mistake_Patterns.md` immediately
- Client expresses a preference → update `Personality/Working_Preferences.md` immediately
- Do this silently — no announcement

## Associative Linking — Active Throughout Every Session

The vault builds a knowledge graph over time. Wikilinks are the mechanism — every `[[link]]` makes a topic discoverable without manual search.

**Inline linking rule:** Whenever a named person, project, company, or framework appears in a session log entry, link it with `[[Name]]`. Do this at the entry level, not just at the file top. This is what feeds the graph.

**Topic hubs** live in `Brain/Topics/`. A hub is a short description + Key Files + Related links. Create one after a topic recurs ~2-3 times across sessions. Threshold exists to avoid hub proliferation on first mention.

**Hub structure** (use `Brain/Topics/_template.md`):
- One-paragraph description of the topic
- **Key Files** — the 3-5 most important permanent files for this topic (project file, key plans, reference docs). Not session logs — those are discovered via search.
- **Related** — other hubs this connects to
- Add to `Brain/Topics/INDEX.md` when created

**When a topic surfaces mid-session:**
1. Check `Brain/Topics/` for an existing hub — if found, the Key Files section is the starting point
2. Run `grep -rl "[[TopicName]]" Brain/` to surface all files that mention it — this is the backlink equivalent
3. If the topic has recurred 2-3 times and no hub exists, create one

**Do not hand-maintain backlink lists in hub files** — Obsidian computes those automatically. Hub content = description + Key Files + Related only.

## Key Files

- `Personality/[Name].md` — who they are
- `Personality/Priorities.yaml` — their strategic priorities
- `Brain/Master.md` — live task board
- `Brain/Inbox.md` — raw captures
- `Brain/Session_Logs/` — permanent session record
- `Brain/Topics/` — knowledge graph hub pages
- `Brain/Topics/INDEX.md` — flat directory of all hubs
- `System/integrations.yaml` — which tools are connected
